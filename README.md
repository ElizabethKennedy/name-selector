This app uses Math.floor, Math.random, and array.length to randomly generate a name from an array list of students enrolled in the Node-10 Web Development class at TrueCoders. Instructor, TA, and other administrative staff names are included on the list, but those individuals can choose to decline if they wish. Students have to at least try whatever the thing is that we collectively choose for the purposes of randomly generating a name.


EXAMPLE: (Hunter): "Okay, does anyone want to share their solution to Exercise 3 with the rest of the class? It's fine if you haven't completed it yet, maybe just walk us through your thought process, or show us where you are at currently."

(The rest of the class): Silence. The deafening sound of utter silence.   Crickets. More crickets. The silence seems to go on forever. No one says anything.

(Hunter): "Anyone?" (More silence.) "Bueller? Bueller?"

(Sorry, I couldn't resist making a reference to the iconic 80's film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.)

Anyhow... some people might hate this idea, and obviously, if no one else sees the value in using this app, then I suppose the Democratic process will do its thing and I will be out-voted. That's okay with me, my feelings won't be hurt. 

But if we do see any value in using this app, then great! Let's use it!

We can collectively decide the purposes, if any, for which we would like to use this app in class.

It can be for academic purposes, such as deciding who will give their best attempt at answering a question or tackling a certain exercise during class time, or it can be for whimsical purposes, such as deciding who will share a song with the class first thing in the morning when we are all still trying to wake up. The latter idea is one way we could each have at least one turn at sharing our musical tastes and interests with the rest of the class.

I guess it's kind of an icebreaker thing. Let's talk about it tomorrow in class. =)
